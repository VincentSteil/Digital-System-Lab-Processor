Digital-System-Lab-Processor
============================

This is the second and third part of the Digital System Laboratory coded in Verilog. 

It contains a single cycle modified Harvard Architecture processor that interfaces with multiple peripherals accessed via memory mapped I/O.

Peripherals include a PS2 mouse port, a VGA port, and an IR controller.

I also wrote also a basic python assembler+linker for a modified version of the ISA that the processor had to use. That way we didn't need to write machine code and could use a pseudo-MIPS like assembly language.   

Besides the professor that provided us with skeleton code, the collaborators on this are:

Vincent Steil

Finn Tessier-lavigne

Mihail Dimitrov Mitev
