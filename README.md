This is the second and third part of the Digital System Laboratory coded in Verilog. 
It contains a single cycle Von-Neuman processor that interfaces with multiple peripherals accessed via memory mapped I/O.
Peripherals include a PS2 mouse port, a VGA port, and an IR controller.
Besides the skeleton code that was provided to us, the collaborators on this are:
